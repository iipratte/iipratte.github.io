    <div class="card">
        <p>I am a junior at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Business, studying Information Systems.</p>
        <p>I am interested in how personal financial decisions shape people's time, freedom, and quality of life. I aspire to earn the CFP® designation and work as a personal financial planner, helping families align their resources with their goals and values.</p>
        <p>Outside of the classroom, I have experience in accounting, legal filing, and data entry. In my most recent role, I worked in a legal setting where I supported the accounts payable process and utilized my technical skills in VBA and Excel to improve financial accuracy and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I have hands-on experience with tax through BYU's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program (VITA), where I prepared and filed federal and state tax returns for low-income earners, helping people maximize their refunds while ensuring IRS compliance.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love hiking and camping, reading, longboarding, watching movies, and Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking personal financial planning or tech related internship opportunities for fall 2025 or spring/summer 2026. I plan to graduate from BYU in April 2027.</p>
